# Pedro Fonseca - Data Analyst / Political Scientist 

## 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a political scientist seeking to understand reality through data. My interest in data analysis began with the socioeconomic analyses I conducted during my undergraduate studies, master's program, and internships. Just as fascinating as analyzing the data is understanding the context in which it is embedded and seeing how reality becomes clearer.
